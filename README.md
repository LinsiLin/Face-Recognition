# Face Recognition by Eigenface
## Matlab Fast Prototyping
A face recognition system using Eigenface algorithm. 

Data: a set of  32x32 8 bit facial images.
• ALL = FA+FB (for Training)
• FA: 12 32x32 8bit facial images (for
Known faces DB)
• FB: 23 facial images (for Test Set)

The code contains 3 components:
•  Image I/O + visualization
•  PCA for learning
•  Recognition by nearest neighbor classification
